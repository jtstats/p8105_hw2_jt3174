## **Problem 0**

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

To that end:

  - create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming
    this repo / directory p8105\_hw2\_YOURUNI (e.g. p8105\_hw2\_ajg2202
    for Jeff), but that’s not required
  - create a single .Rmd file named p8105\_hw2\_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders
    to **github\_document**
  - create a subdirectory to store the local data files used in Problems
    1 and 2, and use **relative paths** to access these data files
  - submit a link to your repo via Courseworks

Your solutions to Problems 1, 2, and 3 should be implemented in your
.Rmd file, and your git commit history should reflect the process you
used to solve these Problems.

For this Problem, we will assess adherence to the instructions above
regarding repo structure, git commit history, and whether we are able to
knit your .Rmd to ensure that your work is reproducible. Adherence to
appropriate styling and clarity of code will be assessed in Problems 1+

## **Problem 1**

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

**Read and clean** the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

  - specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in **read\_excel**
  - use reasonable variable names
  - omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  - round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
    the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
Prec_2017 = 
  # read the data in the sheet precipation 2017 and skip the first row
  read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  # clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # rename total column to precipitation
  rename(precipitation = total) %>% 
  # omit rows without precipitation data
  drop_na(precipitation) %>% 
  # add a variable year
  mutate(year = "2017") %>% 
  # omit total raw
  drop_na(month)


Prec_2018 = 
  # read the data in the sheet precipation 2018
  read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  # clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # rename total column to precipitation
  rename(precipitation = total) %>% 
  # omit rows without precipitation data
  drop_na(precipitation) %>% 
  # add a variable year
  mutate(year = "2018") %>% 
   # omit total raw
  drop_na(month)

# Now combine two datasets
Prec_data = 
  full_join(Prec_2017, Prec_2018) %>% 
  # convert month to a character variable
  mutate(month = month.name[month],       # [] reads the index
         # make everything in month to their lower cases
         month = str_to_lower(month))    
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "precipitation", "year")

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?

## **Problem 2**

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day
variable.

``` r
pols_month = 
  # read the dataset
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  # clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month","day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  # change month format from 01 to 1 and so on
  mutate(month = as.integer(month)) %>% 
  
  ########## TEST ###########
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  ###########################

  # put the month in order from Janurary to December and years from earlier to later
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  # replace month number with month name
  mutate(month = month.name[month], 
         # make everything in month to their lower cases
         month = str_to_lower(month)) %>% 
  # create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_gop and prez_dem
  pivot_longer(
    c("prez_gop", "prez_dem"),
    names_to = "president",
    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "value") %>% 
  filter(!(value == "0")) %>%    # remove all observations that is a false
  select(year, month, everything(), -value, -day)   # keep only the variable president taking values gop and dem, put year and month as leading columns, and remove day variable
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp_data = 
  # read the dataset
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  # clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day","year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  # change month format from 01 to 1 and so on
  mutate(month = as.integer(month)) %>% 
  
  ############# TEST ##############
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  #################################

  # put the month in order from Janurary to December and years from earlier to later
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  # replace month number with month name
  mutate(month = month.name[month], 
         # make everything in month to their lower cases
         month = str_to_lower(month)) %>% 
  # put year and month as leading columns, and remove day variable
  select(year, month, everything(), -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment_data = 
  # read the dataset
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  # clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # switch from "wide" to "long"
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  # make the name of each month to their full names
    mutate(month = str_subset(month.name, str_to_sentence(month)),
         # make everything in month to their lower cases
         month = str_to_lower(month)) %>% 
  
  ################ TEST #################
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  #######################################

  # put year and month as leading columns
  select(year, month, everything())
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
merge_data = 
  # merging snp into pols
  left_join(pols_month, snp_data, by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  # merging unemployment into the result
  left_join(., unemployment_data, by = c("year","month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

Note: we could have used a date variable as a key instead of creating
year and month keys; doing so would help with some kinds of plotting,
and be a more accurate representation of the data. Date formats are
tricky, though. For more information check out the lubridate package in
the tidyverse.

## **Problem 3**

This problem uses data from NYC Open data on the popularity of baby
names, and can be downloaded here.

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables changed over time; you’ll need to
address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem duplicated, and
these will need to be removed (hint: google something like “dplyr remove
duplicate rows” to get started).

Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this
should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year. Produce a similar
table showing the most popular name among male children over time.

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).
