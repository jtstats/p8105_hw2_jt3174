\#\#**Problem 0**

This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the
use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your
work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load
data from local files, and reasonable naming structures for your files.

To that end:

  - create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming
    this repo / directory p8105\_hw2\_YOURUNI (e.g. p8105\_hw2\_ajg2202
    for Jeff), but that’s not required
  - create a single .Rmd file named p8105\_hw2\_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders
    to github\_document
  - create a subdirectory to store the local data files used in Problems
    1 and 2, and use relative paths to access these data files
  - submit a link to your repo via Courseworks
